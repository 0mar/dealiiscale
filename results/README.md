# Results folder

After building, this folder will be copied and filled with

- Solution representations in `.gpl` files
- Convergence tables in `.txt.` files

In addition, the files already present are able to post-process the solution files into figures, which can subsequently be used for reports.

The file `plot_convergence.ipynb` creates plots from the `manufactured` targets and tests for convergence.
